The Systemic effect occurs when essential oils are absorbed through the skin into the Lymphatic circulation, and they are then dumped from the lymphatics into the blood stream. Once circulating in the blood stream, they are carried to their target organs where they exert a therapeutic effect on specific tissues. Every Essential Oil has its own Target Organ e.g. Juniper oil targets the urinary tract and kidneys in particular, with secondary effects on the digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems.","On the mind and emotions via the Sense of Smell and the Limbic System: Even when Essential Oils are inhaled only, in the form of steam inhalation for a cold, or as a fumigator in the background for psychological effect, the oils will be absorbed across the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and lungs into the blood stream, where once again they can travel around the body quickly to their Target Organ."]}),s.default.createElement(u.default,null,"Some common properties include"),s.default.createElement(m.default,{list:["Antiseptic","Anti-inflammatory","Cytophylactic","Sedative","There are oils that act on; Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Apathy, Confusion, Dwelling in the Past, Fear, Grief, Hyper-sensitive, Impatience/ Irritability, Jealousy, Panic, Shock, Suspicion, Euphorics, Aphrodisiacs, Regulators, Mental Stimulants, Sedatives, Invigorators."]}))}},222:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t(115)}},[222]);
