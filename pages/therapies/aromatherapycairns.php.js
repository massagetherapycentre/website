    <Heading>Definition of Aromatherapy</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      {`The literal definition of Aromatherapy implies the use of AROMAS or AROMATIC substances as a THERAPY or to achieve a THERAPEUTIC RESULT, by way of the Sense of Smell. This is an accurate description, yet does not describe the many ways in which Essential Oils and other Aromatic Plant substances can be used. Hence ESSENTIAL OIL THERAPY is a more accurate way of defining the art and practice of Aromatherapy.`}

    <Heading>How Do Essential Oils Work?</Heading>

        `On the physical body, both locally and systematically, via the lymphatic and blood circulation.`,
        `When applied to the body surface via massage, baths, compresses, or lotions, they have a local effect, i.e. the site of application, and Systemically i.e. throughout the body. The Systemic effect occurs when essential oils are absorbed through the skin into the Lymphatic circulation, and they are then dumped from the lymphatics into the blood stream. Once circulating in the blood stream, they are carried to their target organs where they exert a therapeutic effect on specific tissues. Every Essential Oil has its own Target Organ e.g. Juniper oil targets the urinary tract and kidneys in particular, with secondary effects on the digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems.`,
        `On the mind and emotions via the Sense of Smell and the Limbic System: Even when Essential Oils are inhaled only, in the form of steam inhalation for a cold, or as a fumigator in the background for psychological effect, the oils will be absorbed across the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and lungs into the blood stream, where once again they can travel around the body quickly to their Target Organ.`,
