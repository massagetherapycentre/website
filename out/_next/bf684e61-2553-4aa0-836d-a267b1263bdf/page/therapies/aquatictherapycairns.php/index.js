Watsu® is a gentle form of bodywork therapy performed in warm water. It combines elements of massage, joint mobilisation, muscle stretching and dance. The deeply relaxing effects of warm water and nurturing support, combine with Watsu® movements, stretches, massage and meridian point work to create therapeutic benefits and potential healing. There are documented benefits in decreasing pain and improving quality of movement for people with; traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, arthritus, cancer survivors, Fibromyalgia, Cerebral Palsy, Parkinsons\' Disease, anxiety, and chronic pain. As well, Watsu® is great for able bodied people wanting to release tension, relax, and have an experience that is often described as "bliss". Unlike Physiotherapy in the water,the Watsu® Therapist supports the receivers head and neck so that they can completely relax, letting go of physical restraints, and the mental impediment of "mind chatter".

Theri is a certified instructor of practitioners and teachers of the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association (WABA). AQUATHERICS® trained professionals complete classes developed out of Theri's extensive study of Holistic Health and her keen awareness and attention to connection, alignment, body mechanics, technique and learning styles. Her background as a Holistic Health Practitioner includes practitioner status and teaching certification in four other existing styles of Aquatic Bodywork as well as in many other styles of massage, fitness and hypnotherapy. Although there are obvious similarities among the many styles of Bodywork, Theri discovered there are also very different driving principles at the core of each approach. By focusing on these truths rather than choreography or sequence and by creating exercises on the spot to address getting the feeling of the principle in our own body, we can truly be available to join the being we are floating with in the water in awareness. We can fully be with the person in each moment and each movement with the confidence a strong foundation of principles gives us. Quality of touch and movement through awareness allows us to be with each person where they are in their life process. Having a broad knowledge base to draw from we meet the needs of a wide variety of clients whether the client is seeking relaxation, stress reduction, pain management, relief from medical conditions or from emotional unrest. Each person finds their balance of the mind body and spirit in their own way."))}},221:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(114)}},[221]);
